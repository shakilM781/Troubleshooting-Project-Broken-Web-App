# Broken Web App Challenge

## Description

In this lab you will use an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy a web application that runs on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). However, the application is not deployed correctly. If you try and visit the DNS name of the load balancer you will receive an error. Your task is to fix the problems that are preventing the application from working correctly.

Note: This is not an exercise in fixing the CloudFormation template, you are trying to fix the live environment, CloudFormation is only used in this scenario to deploy the lab.
